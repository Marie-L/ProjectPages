## Project Pages Working Prototype

### Intro

This is a WIP working prototype of a feature that I pitched to The Wellcome Trust.

I worked within a team who proposed an idea to improve infrastructure. Our aim was to support staff across the organisation to work more collaboratively and 
efficiently. This has resulted in me becoming the co - owner of a medium sized feature, 
working title: _‘Project Group Pages’_  template for the organisation’s intranet, _Trustnet_.

As part of my apprenticeship final project I build the first stage of this prototype, the database.
I learned and built everything from scratch using docker, postgreSQL, SQL and was able to connect it
to a Flask application and query it using python. This is an ongoing project and the next stages 
include building a front-end and render the results in a user interface similar to that which was 
presented in our original pitch. This project is being supervised by my mentor, James.
