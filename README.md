## Project Pages Working Prototype

### Intro

At the Wellcome Trust, I worked within a team who proposed an idea to improve
infrastructure. Our aim was to support staff across the organisation to work more collaboratively and 
efficiently. This has resulted in me becoming the co - owner of a medium sized feature, 
‘Project Group Pages’  template for the organisation’s intranet, Trustnet.

The Trustnet team devised a way to implement it while still accommodating our original aims. 
The final result is a new ‘Project Group Pages’ template. 

We are involved in UX discovery and I have been invited to work alongside the Trustnet developers once 
development begins. However, I’ve started developing a working prototype of this feature, 
an API in Python, for my portfolio. I’m using Venv virtual environment as a lightweight alternative to 
Pipenv and I’ll be using Flask to build the server. This is a WIP project and is being supervised by my mentor, James, 
and I expect to have an MVP by late-August. 

This is the repo of my version of the prototype.
