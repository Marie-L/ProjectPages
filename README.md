## Wellcome Map Working Prototype

### Project Summary

The Wellcome Map is a new way of accessing and navigating institutional knowledge and expertise in Wellcome. To make the diversity of expertise, experience, and interests at Wellcome available to everyone on Trustnet.

The team is comprised of apprentices and graduates who proposed this idea as part of the Truell Challenge. The Truell Challenge is an opportunity for graduates and apprentices to work together to come up with ways to improve Wellcome. It's also a way of paying homage to the trust's Emeritus Partner, Danny Truell, who set-up of the early careers programmes and supports early career development.
 
 
 The Wellcome is a suite of upgraded features for TrustNet which included:

- new personal profiles

- new departmental pages

- a project tracker

- a new projects landing page and improved tagging functionality

Aims

- to help us work smarter be more efficient

- to transform skills sharing and collaboration at Wellcome

- to improve the functionality of tags to allow users to search easily for skills

- to improve individual work streams and support large projects and staff networks.

- to prevent the duplication of work (to provide a clear, streamlined process for bringing together colleagues who can offer relevant support and insight into shared work)
